# Elevators Management System
This project is a React and JavaScript-based application designed to manage an elevators system. The goal of the project is to create a flexible and scalable solution that can accommodate buildings of any size, and take all elevators call by order. The core functionality of the system includes:

- Creating a scalable solution to manage elevator systems of any size and complexity
- Maintaining a call queue to track every user-generated elevator call and consuming them in order of submission
- Prioritizing elevators based on their distance from the floors where calls are made, in order to improve response times and overall efficiency
## Flow

1. Users click on the call buttons on a floor to request an elevator, which changes the button's status from "call" to "waiting".
2. The system assigns the closest elevator to the call.
3. A timer appears on the floor to show when the elevator is expected to arrive.
4. The elevator arrives, and after a 2-second delay, it becomes available to respond to the next call.
