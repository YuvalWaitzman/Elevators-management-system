# Lift-UI
This project is a React and JavaScript-based application designed to manage an elevators system. The goal of the project is to create a flexible and scalable solution that can accommodate buildings of any size, and take all elevators call by order. The core functionality of the system includes:

- Creating a scalable solution to manage elevator systems of any size and complexity
- Maintaining a call queue to track every user-generated elevator call and consuming them in order of submission
- Prioritizing elevators based on their distance from the floors where calls are made, in order to improve response times and overall efficiency
