# Elevators Management System
This project is a React and JavaScript-based application designed to manage an elevators system. The goal of the project is to create a flexible and scalable solution that can accommodate buildings of any size, and take all elevators call by order. The core functionality of the system includes:

- Creating a scalable and responsive solution for managing elevator systems of any size and complexity.
- Implementing a call queue to track every user-generated elevator call and ensure that they are consumed in the order of submission, improving overall efficiency and     reducing wait times.
- Prioritizing elevators based on their distance from the floors where calls are made, in order to optimize response times and improve system performance.
- Creating a state updating system to manage the real-time status of elevator buttons and elevators with redux, ensuring that users are able to receive accurate information and that the system is able to respond quickly to changes in demand.
## Flow

1. Users click on the call buttons on a floor to request an elevator, which changes the button's status and color.
2. The system assigns the closest elevator to the call.
3. A timer appears on the floor to show when the elevator is expected to arrive.
4. The elevator arrives, and after a 2-second delay, it becomes available to respond to the next call.

## Technologies Used

### React.js
## styled-components
## Redux

- Redux Toolkit - A library that simplifies the process of using Redux, a state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides utilities for writing reducers, creating actions, and generating store configuration.
